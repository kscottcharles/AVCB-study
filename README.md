**Description of Data:** 
This dataset comes from a parent-child dyad study examining the relations between parents and children's authoritarian values and diversity ideologies. 

Among *children*, we measured:
  Authoritarian values (1 measure: series of binary choices)
  Diversity ideologies (1 measure: series of binary choices) 

Among *adults*, we measured:
  Authoritarian values (1 measure: series of binary choices)
  Diversity ideologies (2 measures: binary choice, series of 7-point scales). 

Parents also responded to some exploratory questions, including their perceptions of the teacher's vs. parents' responsibility in addressing racism and diversity, equity, and inclusion with children (7-point scales).
