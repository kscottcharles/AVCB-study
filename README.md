let's push now :)

# Description of Data:   
This dataset comes from a parent-child dyad study examining the relations between parents and children's authoritarian values and diversity ideologies. 

**Among *children*, we measured:**  
  Authoritarian values (1 measure: series of binary choices)  
  Diversity ideologies (1 measure: series of binary choices) 

**Among *adults*, we measured:**  
  Authoritarian values (1 measure: series of binary choices)  
  Diversity ideologies (2 measures: binary choice, series of 7-point scales). 

Parents also responded to some exploratory questions, including their perceptions of the teacher's vs. parents' responsibility in addressing racism and diversity, equity, and inclusion with children (7-point scales).

# Overview of Planned Project:  
In this project, we make the following predictions*:  
*H1:* Parents’ authoritarian values will positively predict children’s own authoritarian values and this relation will strengthen with age.    
*H2:* Parents’ racial ideology will positively predict children’s own diversity ideology, and this relation will strengthen with age.    
*H3:* Higher authoritarian values will positively predict more colorblind attitudes.   

We plan to examine the following:  
**RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PARENT VARIABLES**
Authoritarian values & Classroom choices  
Classroom choices & COBRAS  
Authoritarian values & COBRAS  
Authoritarian values & Responsibility  
Classroom choices & Responsibility  
Responsibility & COBRAS  

**RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHILD VARIABLES**
Authoritarian values & Classroom choices  
Authoritarian values & Age  
Age and Classroom Choices  

**RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD VARIABLES**  
Relations between Authoritarian Values  
Relations between Classroom Choice and other Colorblind/Color-conscious Values (COBRAS, Responsibility)
